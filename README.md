# iOSFlare

Way before location sharing became the norm in messaging apps like Messenger, a group of college friends wanted an easy way to send their location to each other. And thus Flare was born ! A native iOS and a native Android application, developed by me, and tested by my friends to share our location with each other. Very soon though i realized that the demand for this app was way more than just my personal college group. So i decided to flesh it out some more and release it to both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.

It received enough traffic that it broke the original hodge-podge server i had scraped together, so i eventually switched to a full-fledge cloud provider.

At it's peak it had over 5000 Monthly Active Users around the world across both platforms (Android and iOS).

Eventually though, as more and more messaging applications added location sharing as the norm, the demand for Flare waned and so it stopped receiving updates and eventually faded away from both Apple & Android app stores.

But it still serves a really nice purpose as a portfolio piece ! It is not my latest work (as the last Git commit clearly shows), but it is a high quality work that used the latest and up-to-date iOS patterns at that time. And this portfolio piece is what allowed me to get my first professional iOS role developing the Freelancer iOS app (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freelancer-hire-find-jobs/id927810012) in 2017-2018.
